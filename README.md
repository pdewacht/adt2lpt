# Adlib Tracker II for OPL3LPT

This is a version of Adlib Tracker II 2.3.56 modified to support the OPL3LPT board. You can download it from [the Github releases tab][RELEASE].

I will not be updating this project for newer versions of Adlib Tracker II. Instead, you can patch those using my [ADPATCH] utility. (I find FPC a hassle to deal with, and I was never confident that I was building the project correctly.)

For more information on Adlib Tracker II itself, see [the official website][UPSTREAM].
